# Projects To Do App

This is an application for companies that allows them 

to have an overview of individual projects. 

Projects have their tasks and assigned employees.

 
I learned a lot while developing this app. For example, 

how to plan our workflow, 

what components we will need and how they will communicate with each other. 

Then working with the database, form, accordion and modal.

We did the application as a final project in Software Development Academy. 

I worked on it with another student and the trainer helped us improve the code.

The whole design of the app and some parts of the code is my own work.
